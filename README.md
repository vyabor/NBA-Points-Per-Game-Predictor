# NBA-Points-Per-Game-Predictor
Using data of the 2019-2020 NBA season from stats.nba.com, I applied a regression analysis machine learning algorithm on players'
minutes per game, 3 pointers made and attempted per game, offensive and defensive rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per
game, turnovers per game, and blocks per game in order to predict their points per game. I trained the model using 30% of the
total NBA playerbase selected at random.

In the end, the results were better than I had initially expected. The percent error between the sample population and the predicted
points per game was just 1.15%. Further, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 2.80.

The process can be seen in the .ipynb file I have attached. There is also a scatter plot showing the relationship between the predicted
and actual points per game. This graph had a correlation coefficient of 0.918.

As a result, my machine learning algorithm was a success.

Credit goes to:

The National Basketball Association for their statistics
University of California at San Diego for their course on Edx.org called DSE200x where I learned to apply the machine learning method.
